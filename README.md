# Automation Testing using JavaScript
JavaScript automation testing is the process of using JavaScript to write test scripts and run them using JavaScript testing frameworks without any human interference.

It is employed by developers and software testers to verify that a software or web application functions correctly during user interactions. This form of testing is applied across multiple stages of software testing, encompassing various levels of testing processes.

Unit Testing: A type of software testing that involves testing individual units or components of code such as functions, methods, or classes.
Integration Testing: A type of software testing that involves testing whether different units or components of code work together correctly.
End-to-end Testing: A type of software testing, also known as E2E testing, involves testing the entire software application, including all its components and third-party dependencies.
To automate the process of test execution, you can leverage JavaScript testing frameworks, libraries, test runners, and assertion libraries.

JavaScript test frameworks provide a structured environment for executing automated tests using JavaScript. Some of the most common JavaScript testing frameworks include Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.
JavaScript testing libraries offer tools and functions that simplify writing and running tests. Commonly used JavaScript testing libraries include WebdriverIO and Puppeteer.
JavaScript test runners are used to manage the test execution process, handle assertions, and generate detailed reports. Examples of JavaScript test runners include Karma and TestCafe.
JavaScript assertion libraries provide functions for defining assertions to ensure a software or web application does what it is supposed to do. Popular JavaScript assertion libraries include Playwright, Chai, and Expect.js.
